Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills.
It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the 
roject was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how i
t was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.


The link below provides an official example of an expected structure for your readme file, that if followed in its
entirety should get you 4 marks out of 5 on the assessment. To get the maximum 5 marks, you would need to include all
of the parts below and also tailor the readme to your own particular project, providing any additional relevant 
information useful to your users and other developers who may want to contribute to the project.
